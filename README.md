## Description
Project is a part of my studies and was built entirely with HTML and CSS as by requirements of the task (so yes, currently it is just front-end without any back-end: form is NOT working on purpose :grin:)

## Some interesting key-moments learnt from this project:
1. As CSS Framework to create 8-bit vibe I have used [NES.CSS](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/).
2. As font - Google's [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P).
3. All images are mostly Canva's free elements (and some icons from NES.CSS). I put them on canvas with the size of 100px x 100px with different background color depending on the background color of the site. Avatar is generated with [AI Pixel Art Character Generator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-kbcEdBAf1-ai-pixel-art-character-generator?utm_source=gptshunter.com).
4. To create animations: `@keyframes` (I admit there are not a lot of animations, just section divisers, but still... :grin: )

5. Site is responsive for mobile, tablet and computer screens with help of `@media`. This time I've firstly created a website functional for big screen, and then shrink it to mobile. But from previous projects I would say it is much easier to take mobile-first approach (so start with mobile, and then work your design a "way up").
6. Site is deployed and can be visited by this link: https://yanamlnk.github.io/digital-cv/.

> If you need to deploy your project: go to your repo -> Settings -> Pages. And from there you can configure and deploy your project.
7. Mostly everything is in flex-containers divs to manage flexibility of the site. If you want some fun learning flex: welcome to [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) game :frog:
8. Since it was the challenge to use only HTML and CSS (without JS), it was a bit hard to make navigation for mobile without burger menu. Though I did manage to overcome this issue by replacing typical menu with icon-navigation (which is my personal win of creativity :sunglasses:)

Normal navigation:

9. Because of the nature of HTML, I wasn't able to catch all of the errors I made while writing HTML. And there were A LOT of errors (everything worked fine though ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). Still, it is better to validate your HTML in case you misspell some tags, and you can do it [here](https://validator.w3.org). 

## Summary
I really enjoyed doing this project, because even though I am not a master of CSS, I still enjoy the whole elegancy of HTML. And since the huge job in CSS was taken from me by NES.CSS, I mostly got to write just HTML structure with some specific CSS if needed. I do admit that it would be MUCH easier with addition of JS scripts, but that was all about a challenge in the end.
